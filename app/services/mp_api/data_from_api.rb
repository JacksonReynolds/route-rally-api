module MPApi

  # this class will access the Mountain Project API (mp) and retreive details for the climbing routes that fall under
  # the criteria received in the controller. It will bascially just pass the response back to the controller, where the 
  # repsonse will be assessed as successful or not (based on the value of the success key of the returned json).
